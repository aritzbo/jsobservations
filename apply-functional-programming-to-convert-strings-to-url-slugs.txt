/*
Many content management sites (CMS) have the titles of a post added to part of the URL for simple bookmarking purposes. For example, if you write a Medium post titled "Stop Using Reduce", it's likely the URL would have some form of the title string in it (".../stop-using-reduce").

Fill in the -urlSlug- function so it converts a string title and returns the hyphenated version for the URL. You can use any of the methods covered in this section, and don't use [replace]. Here are the requirements:
-- The input is a string with spaces and title-cased words
-- The output is a string with the spaces between words replaced by a hyphen (-)
-- The output should be all lower-cased letters
-- The output should not have any spaces
*/

function urlSlug(title) {
  return title
    .split(/\W/)
    .filter(obj => {return obj !== ""})
    .join("-")
    .toLowerCase()
}

urlSlug("Hold The Door") // Returns "hold-the-door"
